        Climes Group was established in 2023 for the purpose of advancing climate resilience in buildings.
        The climate crisis is a critical threat to humanity, and we rely on our buildings for shelter from extreme weather.
        Yet our buildings aren't designed for the future, they are built to a climate that will never occur again.
        Our mission is to advance climate resilience for all buildings in Canada.</p>

      <h3>Climate Resilience</h3>
      <p>
        We need to both <em>adapt</em> to the impacts of climate change and <em>mitigate</em> our emissions as fast as
        possible to reduce future impacts. This approach is called <em>climate resilience</em>.
        It is the only method we have to prepare ourselves for the future in a resource effective manner.
        The climate resilience approach ensures all our actions achieve both mitigation and adaptation
        through life-cycle thinking.
